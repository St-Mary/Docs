## What is Coral?

Coral is the main bookshop for the Saint Mary's Gate project. This library manages all the important systems, such as JWT token validation, password hashing and SSL validation.

This library also contains all the classes linked to the network between the client and the server, i.e. the definition of packets, the protocol, channels, initializer and other classes needed for the Netty server.
